# burger
Eat da burger is an app in which we create a "homemade" ORM. Node Handlebars are also applied. The overview of this assignment is to highlight the MVC (Model/View/Control) pattern in our file setup.

Node and mysql is used to query and direct (route) data to where to go using "methods" (GET or find, PUT or update, POST or create) to html.
Handlebars (templates) were used to create html.

The burgers are not real and that is sad.
